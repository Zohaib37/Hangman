# Hangman
Hangman game - Keep guessing  
This is a hangman game created using simple python
# How It Works
Initially, the computer chooses a random word which is shown on the screen in the form of blanks. The player starts off with 6 lives and guesses a letter. If the letter is correctly guessed, the blank lines are replaced by the letter where it occurs in the word.\

\
However, if the guessed letter is not in the word, the hangman starts to grow and a life is lost.\

If a wrong letter is guessed and it was already guessed before, lives will not be deducted.\
